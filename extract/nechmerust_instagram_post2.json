{"extracted_information": "The Instagram post from the account 'nech_me_rust' (Let me grow) introduces a new symbol for the organization. The text describes the symbol and the underlying philosophy using metaphors of natural elements: love blossoming like a flower, roots intertwining for stability in creation and growth, water endlessly flowing to cleanse and energize and being a bearer of life, fire awakening wildness and passion, and air being omnipresent, lightening burdens, guiding water, and fueling fire. The new symbol evolved from an 'original seed' which represents the foundational idea and vision of 'Nech mě růst'. This seed, like human beings, carries inherent wisdom and waits for suitable conditions to sprout, take root, grow, and blossom. The post concludes with a wish for everyone to live and grow in harmony, mutual support, and love. The symbol's design is credited to '@kater__inka'.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["Introduction of a new brand symbol for 'Nech mě růst'.", "Philosophical context for the symbol, relating to natural elements (flower, roots, water, fire, air) and their metaphorical significance for growth and being.", "Emphasis on core values: love, stability, cleansing, passion, lightness, harmony, mutual support.", "Concept of inherent wisdom within individuals, akin to a seed's potential.", "Acknowledgement of external conditions shaping personal growth.", "Collaboration with designer '@kater__inka' for the symbol."], "statistics": {"likes": 94, "post_age": "56 weeks"}, "temporal_info": {"post_date": "June 27, 2024 (as seen from system interpretation, though '56w' indicates it's older)", "date_of_scraping": "56 weeks after original post"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": ["Instagram account: @nech_me_rust", "Designer account: @kater__inka", "Hashtag: #nechmerust"]}
