*   **Story-driven:** Share stories about the animals, the community, and the homestead to create an emotional connection with the audience.
*   **Humorous:** Inject humor where appropriate to reflect their personality.

### 6.4. Visuals

*   **High-quality photography and videography:** Invest in professional photos and videos to showcase their work and the beauty of their location.
*   **Consistent branding:** Use the existing logo and color palette throughout the website.
*   **Illustrations:** Incorporate hand-drawn illustrations to add a unique and personal touch.

## 7. Next Steps

*   **Gather more visual assets:** Collect high-quality photos and videos for the new website.
*   **Write detailed copy for each section:** Develop the text for all pages of the website in both Czech and English.
*   **Find examples of their humorous perspective:** Continue to research their social media for specific examples of their humor.


## 8. Humorous Perspective

While direct examples of humor are difficult to extract without full access to their social media, the overall tone is lighthearted and positive. The humor is likely to be found in their day-to-day stories and interactions with the animals, which they share on their Instagram. For example, the snippet "co že jsme vlastně dělali celý rok 24'? ono to tu možná dost..." ("what have we actually been doing all year 24'? it might be here...") suggests a self-aware and slightly sarcastic sense of humor. This kind of understated, authentic humor should be woven into the website's copy, particularly in the blog or stories section.

## 9. Facebook Insights

Their Facebook page reiterates the core themes of nature, self-sufficiency, and community. The tone is described as poetic, peaceful, spiritual, and nurturing.

*   **Location:** Nová ves u Leštiny 32
*   **Events:** They host recurring community events called "Loukáda".

This confirms the consistent branding and messaging across their social media platforms.
